","\"In this first problem, there is a car driving along a cliff, and the car just jumps off. This person has decided to end it all. Now, we want to know at what time the car hits the ground. This is the beauty of physics, because if this were a psychology class we'd want to know why the person was jumping, but we are simply concerned with how long it takes.\"

","\"Say you're in an elevator. I could do two things to you and you wouldn't know the difference. I could pull the elevator up with a rope and you'd begin to feel heavy. Or, I could replace the planet beneath you with a bigger planet and you'd feel heavy. Now most likely I'll do the first one. But you can't tell the difference!\"

","\"Has everyone in here seen an integral? Good. Because I didn't have a backup plan\"
","\"I was teaching a class over the summer, and a student began to get very agitated when I did partial derivatives. He was saying that those weren't a prerequisite for the class, so I shouldn't be teaching them. So I said to him 'you know, the thing about coming to class is- you actually might learn something!'\"
","\"When you draw a box around something, you know it's time to get serious\"
","\"What I see is, the mathematicians tell us what the rules are, and then it's our job to break them\"
","\"You could write a law and think it's correct, and then you'd publish a bunch of papers, and eventually you'd realize that your parents are the only ones reading them and then you'd know that you were wrong. Now, on the other hand, if your friends are reading your papers, your enemies are reading your papers, and then your enemies are stealing what you've written in your papers, then you'll know that your law is correct\"
","\"I've gotta be nice to my students, because one day one of you could be my physician. I could be lying flat on my back, and you could be coming up to me with a mask on and a knife in your hand. I'd say 'What about my anesthesia?' and you'd say 'What about that formula sheet you promised me?', so that's why I try to treat you guys nicely\"

","\"If you look at all the doors at Yale you will notice that the doorknobs are on the opposite side as the hinges, so you get the most action with the least amount of force. Now if you go to Moronland, the doorknobs are all close to the hinges and you can never get anything accomplished\"
