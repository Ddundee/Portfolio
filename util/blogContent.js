				<p>
					There is a point where most programmers decide to make
					a portfolio. Some decide to go the simpler route (the
					better route): they make a really simple website with
					just the necessities like{" "}
					<a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://t3.gg/"
					>
						t3.gg
					</a>{" "}
					Some, like me currently, take the harder way.
				</p>
                <h2 className="text-lg">A doubled edged sword</h2>
				<p>
					Some might say mine is also simple, but it took me too
					much time to setup all the UI. Wasting my time on
					features, just to scrap them since they weren't
					considered as professional. As a programmer, creating a
					portfolio is an important step in showcasing your
					skills and attracting potential clients or employers.
					However, the process of building a portfolio website
					can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's tempting
					to go all out and create a feature-rich, visually
					stunning website that demonstrates your technical
					prowess. On the other hand, this approach can lead to a
					significant time investment and may not always yield
					the desired results.
